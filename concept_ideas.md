## game concepts

### combat concept
- player finds attack items around the game
- 4 equipment slots for different attacks
- different attack weights?
- attacks take action points which you have limited amount each turn (slay the spire inspired?)
- armor/trinkets adjust action point amount

- darkest dungeon style combat? (positions, turns and stuff)
