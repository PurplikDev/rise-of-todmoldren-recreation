## game concepts

### combat concept
- player finds attack items around the game
- 4 equipment slots for different attacks
- different attack weights?
- attacks take action points which you have limited amount each turn (slay the spire inspired?)
- armor/trinkets adjust action point amount

- darkest dungeon style combat? (positions, turns and stuff)
 > each turn the player use one ability per each hero
 > enemy attacks are randomly selected at the start of each turn and shown to the player
 > when the turn ends all characters (including enemies) do their attacks
 > repeat (status effects are applied at the end of each turn)
